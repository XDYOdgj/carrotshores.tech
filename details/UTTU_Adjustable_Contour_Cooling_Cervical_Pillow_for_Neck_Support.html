	var commentsList = [{"user":"Pamela","content":"YES, I mean exactly that, I am 61 years old and this UTTU Sandwich Pillow, Adjustable Memory Foam Pillow IS TRUTHFULLY the very best pillow I have ever slept on or owned.I had a pillow 'like' this twenty something years ago but it wasn't adjustable, I used it for about eight years and my partner used it for another three years, but this pillow is 100x Better than that because it actually fits me.I don't usually do 5 star reviews; 3 is average, 4 is good, 5 stars is outstanding, this pillow IS outstanding!!Being able to take out the middle inch of this UTTU Sandwich Pillow makes this pillow absolutely perfect.The height of the bump on the taller side absolutely cradles my neck and head in exactly the right place.This pillow is not too soft, nor is it too firm, I am mostly a side sleeper, this pillow provides support without crushing my ears.I can also sleep comfortably on my stomach with this pillow, something I can't do at all with any other pillow.No more kinked neck pain, no more morning headaches, and the Memory Foam means the UTTU Sandwich Pillow will last for many years.For real luxury, put a silk pillowcase on this pillow like I have ??.You should know that Memory Foam IS recyclable, I did an online search and found five places in my city that took memory foam mattresses and pillows for free, it's always important to know this before buying anything today.Landfills are filling up all around the world and it's our responsibility to shop wisely and not add to them any more than necessary.night night people,sleep tight . . .","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-06-02 21:26:40"},{"user":"Jeninili","content":"I honestly did not have much of an expectation for this pillow. I assumed it to be another product that promises outcomes that it may or may not keep. The positive reviews swayed me, because the price was a-bit steep for just one pillow. I did keep in mind that what may work for some may not work for others.Do give the pillow a chance to fully expand, I honestly felt unconvinced the first 24-48 hours just by appearance alone. During that time frame it looked extremely flat. It did have somewhat of an odor, slightly chemically, but it fully disappeared by day three. By the third day I also noted the pillow looked and felt completely expanded.I\u2019ve exclusively slept with this pillow for two weeks straight, and have not experienced the unbearable neck and upper back pain that\u2019s been plaguing me each night. This purchase was a last resort, I thought a new mattress would be the only way to relieve my pain. The pillow feels soft with the slightest firmness. I assume the natural contours work their magic, but the pillow conforms to your head and neck very well.Really happy with this pillow and recommend for those experiencing pain while sleeping. It\u2019s worth a try.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-12 21:26:40"},{"user":"Kelsey Hillyer","content":"This is the better of the three memory foam pillows that I purchased. I purchased another pillow from a seller on Amazon that was a completely different type of pillow (even though it is also made of \u201cmemory foam\u201d, it is shredded and not a \u201ccontour\u201d pillow. I purchased a different contour pillow from Macy\u2019s and they sent me the wrong product; I had intended for this pillow (the one that I am reviewing) to be my contour pillow, and the pillow from Macy\u2019s was not supposed to be contoured, but they sent me the contour pillow anyway\u2014so now I have that contour pillow to compare this one to. That pillow is smaller, and even though it is advertised as being \u201coversized\u201d, it is too small for (it does not fill) my standard size pillowcases); thus, the pillowcase slips off. The pillow from Macy\u2019s was listed with the retail price of $139; however, the one that they sent me (that I purchased for $23, so it was supposedly a Black Friday super markdown \u201cdeal\u201d) and I found the same pillow on Amazon for $23, at $89 retail (so I am assuming that Amazon is correctly listing the suggested retail price, whereas Macy\u2019s inflated the retail price in order to give the impression that it was a \u201ccrazy good deal\u201d or that it was a \u201cbargain that could not be refused\u201d for potential buyers and window-shoppers during the Black Friday and \u201ccyber Monday\u201d season of consuming. This pillow (the one that I am reviewing) is far superior to the one that I had gotten \u201csuch an amazing deal on\u201d from the Macy\u2019s Black Friday sale. It is similar in its design, but larger and slightly firmer (it feels higher quality, like it will last longer; and it also stays just as cool as any memory foam pillow I have ever tried (including the \u201chigh end\u201d brand makes and models, even those that boast being exclusively made of Eucalyptus Lyocell, those sold by or marketed alongside the hipster-chic and \u201ceco-conscious\u201d, \u201chumanely\u201d or \u201cethically manufactured\u201d (that claim to be, and hopefully that actually are, but advertising copy can sometimes mislead\u2014even when coming from these supposedly ethical (and certainly upscale) brands. This memory foam contour pillow (the one that I am reviewing) feels as good as Eucalyptus lyocell (it is made of rayon; this pillow is\u2014viscose from bamboo, it is the same process being done to bamboo as is done to Eucalyptus to make the pulp that is viscose that makes rayon\u2014so it does feel the same; it is just that the sustainability factor is not really discussed at all by brands that do not appeal strongly to the eco-chic upscale consumer bracket. I give this pillow a five-star rating in all categories in this review, because it is better than I expected; it is what it is (what it says it ys) and it does not claim to be ethical, sustainable, or revolutionary in terms of its place on the spectrum of memory foam pillows to try. It does not make the claim that this is \u201chealthy\u201d memory foam (there really is no such thing, considering what memory foam actually is). This is a decent pillow. It \u201csleeps cool\u201d and is good for sleeping with spinal alignment issues, in my experience.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-12-04 21:26:40"},{"user":"Kat Miller","content":"This pillow is not what I expected. For about three years I was sleeping on a M# Pill#w..... it was great, for a while.Problem was, it didn't support as well as I thought it did.After putting my back and neck out of place, sleeping on this pillow only served to worsen my back and neck pain. Ended up in chiropractic to get everything realigned.This was the point where I realized I needed a different pillow to properly support my neck.I purchased this pillow as it was the first one I came across and liked what I saw.I have to say, my neck and back pain have basically gone away. My chiropractor says after a couple more fine tuning/evaluation visits I will be down to just check ups every 6 months.All because of this pillow!The material is soft yet, firm. Adjusts to the natural contours of your neck and supports very well. Both sides rise up at different heights to allow for adjustment depending on how big or little you are and it has a removable center baffle for thse who need more support heighy.The pillow cover is zippered for easy access and helps keep the pillow together since it is actually in three separate pieces.The only issue I have is putting the pillow back into the pillow case. The memory foam wants to attach itself to the interior of the case and has kind of a velcro effect that makes it somewhat difficult to position the pillow properly within the case.Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT! Glad I purchased it and highly recommend it for those looking for a good contoured pillow.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-07-27 21:26:40"},{"user":"Kleo","content":"This UTTU Cervical Pillow has been a game-changer for my sleep. The contoured design provides excellent support for my neck and head, alleviating the pain and stiffness I used to experience. The memory foam is soft and comfortable, and it molds perfectly to my neck's natural curvature. Since using this pillow, I've been waking up feeling more refreshed and with less neck pain.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-28 21:26:40"},{"user":"Scott T.","content":"As a chiropractor, I try a lot of different pillows and speak with patients regularly about what pillow they use. I have learned there is no one size fits all - no best pillow for everyone. What I like about this pillow is the ability to make modifications. You can take out one or two layers to customize the height. I even cut a circular hole in the center of the middle layer, making it a bit softer right in the center so I sink in more. Some orthopedic pillows use stiff foam but I find this to be the right mix of soft but still supportive. I bought my own pillow and have gotten nothing from the company for this review, so I truly think it's great!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-13 21:26:40"},{"user":"shrinkwrap","content":"Got the pillow Tuesday night.I let it air out and fluff and then put a pillow protector on it and the pillowcase.Someone woke me up after 5 hours of sleep but with this pillow, I was able to go right back to sleep--and I slept all day until this evening.I needed to catch up after a sinus infection and running a lot of errands.The best part of this is that I awoke WITHOUT A HEADACHE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS.After trying a lot of modalities I was out of ideas as to the cause of these headaches.I had used a cervical pillow for 10 years but it became too hard and too low for me so I changed for a Serta pillow at Walmart and that didn't work long-term.I hope that this is my answer because I am out of ideas for the headaches on the whole right side of my head and I suspected that they were coming out of my neck.Cross your fingers that I get my life back!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-05 21:26:40"},{"user":"Kyli J","content":"Im really impressed with this pillow. Saying that, you need to give it a chance. I bought two, one for my sig. other and I. I had him try the pillow first and the next day he told me it absolutely not going to work for him. I tried it for an hour or two a night just to get used to the difference in support. I have chronic neck pain, and this has help tremedously. I use it every night now, while my sig. other uses it as needed for his own comfort.The pillow comes with a zip up protector on it, and a removable inner layer. I removed the inner layer as that is what is most comfortable to me. I like that I have the option to add the inner layer back in if i want the pillow to be \"beefier\".I'll be buying two more to keep in our travel trailer.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-07 21:26:40"},{"user":"S. Dawson","content":"I bought two cervical support pillows prior to this one. Both were too hard, and was confusing of all things. This one was just right. It is soft but firm at the same time. I like the option of a high and low side. I have not removed any of the filling but might try it. I have a pinched nerve in my neck. I got the standard size, and a standard pillow case fits it perfectly. Sweet dreams!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 21:26:40"},{"user":"Elaine Bohman","content":"I love this pillow! It comes folded up in a box so when you take it out it's disfigured. However, letting it set it comes to life!! It's squishy so i was sure about support for my neck however it's perfect! The delivery is very fast as well! I can definitely see buying another. It's worth the price.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-15 21:26:40"}];
